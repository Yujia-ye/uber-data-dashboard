# uber-data-dashboard

This is a project that visualizes Uber taxi data. The project explores big data storage and how to utilize big data for data mining and analysis purposes. The backend utilizes MongoDB as the storage system and connects to MongoDB using PySpark. The Uber taxi data is used for model training, resulting in a model that can predict Uber taxi prices based on factors such as pick-up and drop-off locations, time periods, and more.

The frontend of the project utilizes JavaScript components such as Echarts and Morris.JS to visualize the Uber taxi data. It includes visualizations of popular taxi periods, popular locations, and more. The website also provides an ad-hoc query feature, allowing users to achieve their desired aggregation granularity through interactive selection.
